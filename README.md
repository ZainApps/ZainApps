## Hi there 👋

I’m Zain and I'm currently working on my Masters in Data Science at UC Berkeley.  
I enjoy building things that make data *useful* — from AI that can spot fractures in X-rays, to workflows that connect data across messy systems, to graph models that help us understand how people and information move.

---

### 💡 What I’m into
- **Machine Learning & AI** — especially when it has a clear, real-world impact.
- **Agentic workflows** — exploring LLMs that can plan, search, and act.
- **Data wrangling & analytics** — clean data is happy data.
- **Graph analytics** — shortest paths, network centrality, and other “find the signal” tricks.

---

### 📌 Featured Projects
- **Bone Fracture Detection (CNN + Grad-CAM)**  
  Deep learning model to flag possible tibia/fibula fractures from X-rays, complete with explainable AI overlays.
- **SQL Entity Resolution Pipeline**  
  Match customers across systems without handing over raw data, complete with precision/recall metrics.
- **Refugee Flows Graph (Neo4j)**  
  Explore shortest paths, hubs, and patterns in migration routes.

### 🌱 Currently learning
- Applied NLP and LLM frameworks
- Agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen)
- How to make side projects actually *look* as good as they work

I'm currently in the process of building my portfolio here and would love any feedback! All hyperlinks will be added in as the projects in question are uploaded to my public repo

If you’re building AI/ML tools that solve real problems or just want to talk I’d love to connect. 🙂
